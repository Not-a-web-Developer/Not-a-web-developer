### hello there

[![forthebadge](/i-cant-design-shit.png)](https://forthebadge.com)

I'm a regular joe who happened to stumble upon git providers like github

I don't really contribute a lot, though that's because of incompetence rather than a lack of interest; I'll just add my stats so you can see it for yourself:

[![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=not-a-web-developer&showicons=true&theme=nord)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Apart from that, I guess check out my gemini blog at [sourcehut](gemini://not-a-web-developer.srht.site) or on [github](https://not-a-web-developer.github.io) based on your personal preference (they're differing levels of insanity)
 
Contact me at newestideaz@gmail.com, you'll most probably receive a flurry of replies within 5-7 business days (i'll probably reply in hours but eh tempering expectations is good for my own sanity)
