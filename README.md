### hello there

[![forthebadge](/i-cant-design-shit.png)](https://forthebadge.com)

I'm a regular joe who happened to stumble upon git providers like github

I don't really contribute a lot, though that's because of incompetence rather than a lack of interest; I'll just add my stats so you can see it for yourself:

[![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=not-a-web-developer)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Apart from that, I guess check my blog out at [sourcehut](not-a-web-developer.srht.site) or on [github](not-a-web-developer.github.io) based on your personal preference (the content is ~~mostly~~ the same)
 
Contact me at newestideaz@gmail.com, you'll most probably receive a flurry of replies within 5-7 business days
